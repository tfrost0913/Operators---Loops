## Operators and Loops

- **Assignment Operators**
- An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand.
- If a variable refers to an object, then the left-hand side of an assignment expression may make assignments to properties of that variable. 
- For more complex assignments, the destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to extract data from arrays or objects using a syntax that mirrors the construction of array and object literals.
- **Comparison Operators**
- A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true. The operands can be numerical, string, logical, or object balues. Strings are compared based on standard lexicographical ordering, using Unicode values.
- **For Statements**
- A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. The JavaScript for loop is similar to the Java and C for Loop.
- **While Statements**
- A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows: If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop. The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is tested again.  If the condition returns false, execution stops, and control is passed to the statement following while.
